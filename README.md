# Lens - search engine

<b>Lens</b> is a search engine created from scratch. It is based on about <b>50 000</b> articles crawled from Wikipedia. The project was conducted as a part of Computational Methods for Science and Technology course at AGH UST Computer Science. For more details see my theoretical report with all details about the project <a href="https://github.com/mateuszlampert/Search-Engine/blob/master/report.md">here</a>.

In the example above, we our request is really precise, the difference between engine with and without SVD is not that significant

In the example above, our request is not precise. We provide some context, however, the request does not contain any specific information such as name or surname. In the situation, engine with initialized SVD provided significantly better responses.
